this	O

you	O

The	O

I	O

I	O
need	O

yours	O
approach	O

n't	O

it	O
flush	O

my	O
research	O
tells	O
me	O

this	O

so	O
that	O

out	O

the	O

far	O
in	O
my	O
practice	O

it	O
seems	O

fine	O

I	O

n't	O
seem	O
to	O
find	O
any	O

where	O
what	O
I	O
'm	O
doing	O
is	O
recommended	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
MVP	Algorithm
goes	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
enough	O
self-doubt	O
that	O
I	O
figured	O
I	O
'd	O
ask	O
my	O
first	O
StackOverflow	O
question	O

Having	O
said	O
that	O

I	O
believe	O
this	O

wrong	O
for	O
your	O
