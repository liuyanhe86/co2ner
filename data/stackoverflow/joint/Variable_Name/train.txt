,	O
my	O
idea	O

create	O

no	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
why	O
,	O

i	O
ca	O
n't	O
pick	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
the	O
person__name	Variable_Name
and	O
person__email	Variable_Name
,	O
the	O
most	O
strange	O
part	O
is	O
that	O
i	O
can	O
pick	O
the	O
value	O
in	O
the	O
console	Application
on	O
the	O

someone	O

you	O
