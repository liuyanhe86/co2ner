There are many folks out there that claim their singleton implementation to be robust and general because it uses metaprogramming constructs.

My goal is to enforce a singleton policy onto a derived class so that I do not have to explicitly (manually) declare the derived class' constructors as private.

I think there's a way to naively add the instance static variable and the getter as a policy by making the templated singleton a friend of the class you derive.

But that's not at all elegant.

I started with this code, that, among other things, is given as being a correct (i.e. complete) design of a singleton, while it is clearly allowing for multiple instances:

And a singleton client of this "policy", using CRTP:

NOTE this is not a correct implementation of a CRTP Singleton policy, it's merely part of the question!The code won't compile as is.

The base singleton policy class has its constructor declared private, so it can't support derived instances unless the child is a friend of this class.

People usually make the constructors protected, which means there's nothing to keep a user from making derived class non-singletonian.

Problem/Question: Is there any mechanism to enforce a singleton policy without having to make the derived class' constructors private manually?

I've got this as XML:

I've got this as php:

Now the problem is this, I'm forced to have --INLINE_CODE_BEGIN---$testcase--INLINE_CODE_END--- in a lowercase form (defaultimage) BUT in the XML file the name of the child is: --INLINE_CODE_BEGIN---defaultImage--INLINE_CODE_END--- (note the uppercase I)


Question: How can I handle all the children as lowercases?

While you cannot prevent usage of those inherited members to my knowledge, you should be able to hide them from IntelliSense using the EditorBrowsableAttribute:

Edit: Just saw this in the documentation comments, which makes it kinda useless for this purpose:
